    "1. Special Relativity: Shows that time and space are connected, and that the speed of light is constant for all observers.\n",
    "2. General Relativity: Explains that gravity is a curvature of spacetime caused by mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "- Time dilation: time passes slower for moving objects\n",

    "- Surprisingly, the period doesn't depend on the mass or amplitude (for small swings)\n",

    "- The visible spectrum is just a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum\n",
    "- Light waves can be reflected, refracted, diffracted, and polarized\n",
    "- Prisms separate white light into a spectrum because different wavelengths refract at different angles\n",
